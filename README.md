# -Sentiment-Analysis-using-Social-Media-Data
Organizations use sentiment analysis to understand how the public feels about something at a particular moment in time, and also to track how those opinions change over time.  An enterprise may analyse sentiment about: ✓ A product – For example, does the target segment understand and appreciate messaging around a product launch? What products do visitors tend to buy together, and what are they most likely to buy in the future? ✓ A service – For example, a hotel or restaurant can look into its locations with particularly strong or poor service. ✓ Competitors – In what areas do people see our company as better than (or weaker than) our competition? ✓ Reputation – What does the public really think about our company? Is our reputation positive or negative?
